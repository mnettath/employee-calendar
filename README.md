# employee-calendar

## Description

My motivation for this project was to help employees add important events to manage their time effectively within a 9-5 work day. This project gave me a lot of exposure to jQuery DOM traversal and more practice working with local storage. A challenge that I encountered while working on this project was getting the events to save even after the page had refreshed. This gave me the opportunity to become more familiar with using loops to iterate through arrays.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

## Usage

To use this employee calendar, users can click on the timeslot and type in the event they would like to add. To save this event, they will hit the blue save button to the right. When the page is refreshed, these events will not go away. To delete or add to an existing event, the user will just click on the timeslot again, make the changes, and click on the blue save button again.
